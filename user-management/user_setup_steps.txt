User Management and Access Control Steps

1. Created user accounts:
   - sarah
   - mike

2. Set secure passwords using passwd command.

3. Created isolated workspace directories:
   - /home/sarah/workspace
   - /home/mike/workspace

4. Assigned ownership:
   - sarah owns /home/sarah/workspace
   - mike owns /home/mike/workspace

5. Applied directory permissions:
   - chmod 700 to restrict access

6. Enforced password policy:
   - Password expiry set to 30 days
   - Warning period set to 7 days

7. Verified password policies using:
   chage -l sarah
   chage -l mike

Result:
Each user has a secure, isolated environment with enforced password policies.
